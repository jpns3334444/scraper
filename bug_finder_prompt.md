This codebase was generated by an LLM and hasn't been run yet. I need to find bugs that would prevent it from running successfully on first deployment. An important note is that we are using AWS prebuilt images for lambda functions, which include many of the dependencies. Please analyze for:

## Priority 1 - Deployment Blockers (Will prevent even starting):
- Syntax errors or invalid Python code
- Missing required files referenced in code (configs, schemas, templates)
- Environment variables used but never defined anywhere
- AWS resources referenced but not created in CloudFormation

## Priority 2 - First-Run Failures (Will crash on first execution):
- Uninitialized variables used before assignment
- Function calls with wrong number of arguments
- Accessing dictionary keys or object attributes that don't exist
- Type mismatches (e.g., passing string where list expected)
- Database queries referencing non-existent tables/indexes
- S3 operations on buckets/keys that won't exist
- Hardcoded paths or assumptions about file system

## Priority 3 - Integration Breaks (Will fail when components connect):
- Lambda function signatures not matching Step Functions expectations
- Data format mismatches between pipeline stages
- Missing return values that next stage expects
- Incompatible schema between writer and reader
- Event payload mismatches
- Incorrect AWS service permissions in IAM roles

## Priority 4 - Common LLM Generation Mistakes:
- Placeholder values still in code (like "YOUR_KEY_HERE")
- Inconsistent function/variable naming between files
- Copy-paste errors where variable names don't match
- Half-implemented functions with just "pass" or "TODO"
- Import statements for files that don't exist
- Mixed up parameters between similar functions

## DO NOT report:
- Performance optimizations
- Code style issues
- Security best practices
- Architectural improvements
- Missing error handling (unless it would crash immediately)
- Missing tests or documentation
- Things that would work but could be "better"

## For each issue:
1. Will this prevent deployment? YES/NO
2. Will this crash on first run? YES/NO
4. Provide the minimal fix to make it run (not perfect, just functional)

Focus on getting it to run end-to-end first time, not on making it production-ready. Document your findings in a bugs2.md file.
