  ğŸ”¹ Stage 1: Scraping Infrastructure 
  (Refined)

  Core Infrastructure

  - âœ… CloudFormation stack with EC2, IAM
  roles, Lambda trigger, and cron scheduling       
  - âœ… Headless Selenium scraper with user
  agent rotation
  - âœ… EC2 UserData auto-installs dependencies     
   and CloudWatch agent
  - âœ… S3 integration for storing scraped
  results

  Essential Monitoring & Notifications

  - ğŸ”² SNS topic for email/Slack notifications     
   on job completion/failure
  - ğŸ”² Enhanced Lambda function to monitor         
  scraper execution status
  - ğŸ”² Structured logging with success/failure     
   metrics in scrape.py

  Critical Reliability Fixes

  - ğŸ”² Lambda timeout handling (current 60s        
  timeout vs longer scraping duration)
  - ğŸ”² Bot detection recovery strategy
  (currently just logs and exits)
  - ğŸ”² Rate limiting with respectful delays        
  between requests

  Data Quality

  - ğŸ”² Basic data validation before S3 upload      
  (check for empty results)
  - ğŸ”² Simple deduplication to avoid
  re-scraping same listings daily

  Security Best Practices

  - ğŸ”² Improved scraping delays (currently
  2-4s, could be more variable)
  - ğŸ”² Request headers randomization beyond        
  just User-Agent

  Nice-to-Have

  - ğŸ”² Simple health check via CloudWatch
  custom metrics
  - ğŸ”² Basic error retry logic improvements        
  (currently has some)

  - ğŸ”² CloudWatch alarms for scraper failures      
  and timeouts
  - ğŸ”² Structured logging with success/failure     
   metrics in scrape.py

  Reliability & Error Handling

  - ğŸ”² Lambda timeout handling (current 60s        
  timeout vs longer scraping duration)
  - ğŸ”² Retry logic for failed scraping 
  attempts (partially implemented)
  - ğŸ”² Dead letter queue for failed Lambda         
  invocations
  - ğŸ”² Bot detection recovery strategy
  (currently just logs and exits)
  - ğŸ”² IP rotation mechanism for anti-bot
  measures

  Data Management

  - ğŸ”² S3 lifecycle policies for cost
  optimization (archive old data)
  - ğŸ”² Data deduplication logic to avoid
  re-scraping same listings
  - ğŸ”² CSV/JSON output format standardization      
  with metadata
  - ğŸ”² Data validation and quality checks
  before S3 upload

  Security & Compliance

  - ğŸ”² Rate limiting and respectful scraping       
  delays
  - ğŸ”² User-Agent rotation improvements (more      
  realistic patterns)
  - ğŸ”² Request headers randomization beyond        
  just User-Agent
  - ğŸ”² SSL/TLS certificate validation in
  scraper requests
  - ğŸ”² Environment variable encryption for
  sensitive data

  Operational Excellence

  - ğŸ”² Health check endpoint for EC2 instance      
  monitoring
  - ğŸ”² Scraper performance metrics
  (pages/minute, success rate)
  - ğŸ”² Cost monitoring dashboard for AWS
  resource usage
  - ğŸ”² Automated deployment pipeline
  improvements (current deploy.sh)
  - ğŸ”² Backup strategy for configuration and       
  code

  Future Enhancements

  - ğŸ”² Multi-region deployment for
  geo-distribution
  - ğŸ”² Proxy rotation service integration
  - ğŸ”² Database integration (RDS/DynamoDB) for     
   structured data
  - ğŸ”² API endpoints for external access to        
  scraped data
  - ğŸ”² Real-time data streaming
  (Kinesis/EventBridge)

  The most critical missing items I identified     
   are:
  1. Lambda timeout handling - Your scraper        
  runs much longer than the 60s Lambda timeout     
  2. Proper error monitoring - No visibility       
  into scraper failures
  3. Bot detection recovery - Currently just       
  exits on detection
  4. Rate limiting - Missing respectful delays     
   between requests
  5. Data deduplication - May be re-scraping       
  same listings daily
